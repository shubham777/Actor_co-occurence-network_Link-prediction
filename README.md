# Actor_co-occurence-network_Link-prediction
As part of our research in network analysis and machine learning, we recently worked a project on Actor Co-occurrence Network and Link Prediction. Our aim was to predict missing links in an actor co-occurrence network, where nodes correspond to actors and edges represent co-occurrence on the same Wikipedia page.
